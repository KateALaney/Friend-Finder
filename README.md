# Friend-Finder
Friend-Finder is an application that allows users to fill in a survey and submit it to find a match for a new friend.

## Introduction
Friend-Finder uses an HTML-and-Javascript-based survey to gather data on a user's characteristics and preferences, stores that data as a JSON object, and then compares it with data already stored to match the new user with a "friend".  The survey and home pages also allow users to view the scores of friends
